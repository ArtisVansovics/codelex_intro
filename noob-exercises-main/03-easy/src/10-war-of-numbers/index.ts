/**
 * There's a great war between the even and odd numbers. 
 * Many numbers already lost their life in this war and it's your task to end this. 
 * You have to determine which group is larger: the even, or the odd. The larger group wins.
 * Create a function that takes an array of integers, sums the even and odd numbers seperately, 
 * then returns "Odd numbers win by X" or "Even numbers win by X", X is survivors.
 * If both groups are equal, return "There are no winners"
