 * So far you've been working with numeric and textual data using JS data types - numbers
 * and strings. But there are many more data types in JS. One of them is arrays.
 * Here are a few resources that might help to better understand what arrays are for:
 *  - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
 *  - https://javascript.info/array
 *
 * If you feel like you need to take a step back and do some more basic exercises
 * follow the link for a bunch of beginner friendly exercises exactly for that:
 *  - https://github.com/codelex-io/noob-exercises/tree/main/02-too-easy
 *
 * But for exercises that are specifically designed to practice array methods, head to this repo:
